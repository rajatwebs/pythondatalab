    "## Standard Scaler\n",
    "The StandardScaler() function is part of the sklearn.preprocessing module in the popular Python machine learning library, scikit-learn. When you apply StandardScaler() to your data, it transforms the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. Specifically, it standardizes the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
